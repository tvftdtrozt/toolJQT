A highly scientific calculator for determining optimal pizza consumption timing and slice distribution algorithms.

**Warning**: This code may contain traces of caffeine and late-night debugging sessions.

## Quick Start (if you're brave)

```bash
npm install pizza-time-calculator
```

## Usage (probably)

```javascript
const { calculateOptimalSliceDistribution } = require('pizza-time-calculator');

// Calculate how many slices each person gets
const result = calculateOptimalSliceDistribution({
  pizzaCount: 3,
  people: 8,
  hungerLevel: 'ravenous'
});

console.log('Slice distribution:', result);
// Output: { slicesPerPerson: 3, leftovers: 0, happiness: 98% }
```
